Overview of all ETL Programs our team created

--Automated ETL program, set to ETL .csv files every minute one file at a time.
schedule.ipynb

--Manual ETL, all files are processed in bulk by the labeled file type, but files have to have the exact same columns.
extract_transform_load_v3_csv.ipynb
extract_transform_load_v3_xlsm.ipynb
extract_transform_load_v3_xlsx.ipynb

--ETL program does not load PDF's yet, will keep on working with it.
extract_transform_load_v2_pdf.ipynb

--Future Projects
Schedule_Python.py and app.py are pet projects
